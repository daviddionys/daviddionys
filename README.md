### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<!--
**daviddionys/daviddionys** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
I am David Dionys, a full stack developer from Belgian descent living in Nicaragua.  I have worked in ICT since 1999; besides working as a developer, I have worked on networks, servers, databases, digital learning materials and IT training.  My development skills have evolved from the now ancient VB 6.0 over Tridion, CMSs like Joomla, Moodle, Drupal and the unevitable Wordpress, towards CakePHP, CodeIgniter and Laravel.  Since 2018 I have been working for new projects with React SPAs (after a brief stint of Vue), and I have deepened this work with projects in Gatsby and Next.  

Coming out of the pandemic, I feel I have now an up-to-date skill set with a good knowledge of both frontend (react, tailwind css) and backend; databases hold no surprises for me, I have been working in node and am now learning deno, but as a standard solution I have moved on towards headless solutions with netlify/vercel. In my latest projects, I have been using typescript, which turned out to be of great help after a period of grumbling.

I find ICT an exciting field to work in, and strongly believe in lifelong learning.  I take at least 10 % of my time to stay up to date with the latest technologies of my choice, and find the road towards the goal is as rewarding as the end result.  While trained as an electrical engineer, I also hold degrees in international development and philosophy.
